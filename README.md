# Tweets sentiment analysis for extracting opinion on LGBT

This project aims to investigate some statistics of tweets with the search word of "LGBT", and then perform sentiment analysis to differentiate between pride month sentiments compared to other times. 





Inside the folder "out" exist the scraped tweets in a series of CSV files. 

To execute the program make sure to load LGBT_sentiments_from_tweets.ipynb, that is the script for the whole flow (Make sure to install the needed requirements for execution), which includes all of the outputs of the execution.

Small warning run time: A full execution might take a LONG time. Avoid executing the scraper search cell that appear as an example, and the sentiment analyzers processes, that could last several hours.
